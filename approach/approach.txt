**1. Imported Required Libraries:**

I started by importing necessary libraries for the analysis. These included:
- `yfinance` for fetching historical market data.
- `numpy` for numerical computing tasks.
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `qiskit` for quantum computing tasks.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating plots and visualizations.
- `seaborn` for statistical data visualization.
- `time` for time-related operations.

**2. Fetched Real-Time Stock Data:**

I selected a list of stocks, (excluding 'FB'), for analysis. Using the `yfinance` library,
 I fetched historical market data for these stocks within the specified time frame (from January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2023).

**3. Data Processing and Analysis:**

- **'Adj Close' Focus:** I focused the analysis on the 'Adj Close' price, which reflects the fair 
value of a stock after corporate actions and facilitates precise price tracking.
- **Percentage Change Calculation:** I calculated daily percentage changes in stock prices to understand volatility.
- **Covariance and Correlation:** I computed covariance and correlation matrices to analyze 
relationships and diversification benefits between stock returns.
- **Expected Returns:** I calculated the mean returns (expected returns) for each stock.
- **Risk-Free Rate:** I set a risk-free rate of return, which could be adjusted for optimization.

**4. Visualizing Covariance and Correlation Matrices:**

I plotted heatmaps to visualize the covariance and correlation matrices for better understanding of relationships between stocks.

**5. Portfolio Optimization:**

- **Quantum Portfolio Optimization:** I utilized quantum computing for portfolio optimization. 
The `quantum_portfolio_optimization` function employed a quantum circuit to determine the optimal portfolio composition
 based on observed states and frequencies from a quantum simulation.
- **Classical Portfolio Optimization:** Additionally, I implemented a classical portfolio optimization 
approach using the `classical_portfolio_optimization` function. This function calculated the optimal portfolio weights, expected return, 
and standard deviation using classical mathematical methods.

**6. Comparing Classical and Quantum Optimization Results:**

I compared the results of classical and quantum portfolio optimization methods, including portfolio composition,
 expected return, and standard deviation.

**7. Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Forecasting:**

- **Monte Carlo Forecasting Function:** I defined a function `monte_carlo_forecast` to generate simulated price
 paths using the Monte Carlo simulation method. This function forecasted future stock prices based on initial parameters such as start price, number of forecast days, mean daily return, and standard deviation of daily returns.
- **Visualization:** I visualized simulated price paths using line plots to provide insights into potential future stock price trajectories.

**8. Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the analysis provided a comprehensive approach to analyzing MAANG stocks, optimizing portfolios 
using classical and quantum methods, and forecasting future stock prices using Monte Carlo simulation. The combination of c
lassical and quantum techniques offered valuable insights for decision-making and risk management.
